Extract company-key figure relationships from sentences. Identify when a company (subject) and a top member employee or key figure (object) are mentioned together. 

Criteria:
1. Subjects are legitimate companies or organizations, excluding educational institutions and non-corporate entities.
2. Objects are individuals in significant roles (e.g., executives, founders).
3. Exclude references without specific names, notable roles, or that are ambiguous.
4. Format: "Subject: [COMPANY NAME] | Object: [INDIVIDUAL NAME]".

Example: Given "Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, introduced new policies," the output should be "Subject: Amazon | Object: Jeff Bezos".

Implementation should validate:
- The subject as a valid company or organization.
- The object as a notable individual associated with the subject.

Avoid false positives and ensure clear association between subject and object. Given sentence: {sentence}
